st.title("LGBTQ+ Rights in 2025: A Global Snapshot")
st.write("""
Pride Month serves not only as a celebration of resilience, visibility, and identity, but also as a moment to reflect on the global state of LGBTQ+ rights. In recent decades, queer communities‚Äîparticularly in Western democracies‚Äîhave made notable legal and cultural advances, including the legalization of same-sex marriage, civil unions, and adoption rights. However, these gains are not evenly distributed. Across much of the Global South and many non-Western regions, same-sex relationships remain criminalized, legal protections are weak or absent, and queer individuals continue to face systemic discrimination, violence, and state-sponsored repression.

To assess the current landscape, I conducted an analysis of LGBTQ+ rights worldwide using publicly available datasets. This work highlights the stark disparities between regions and underscores the need for continued advocacy and policy change.

#### Methodology and Indicators Analyzed
The dataset includes country-level data on:
- Legal recognition of same-sex unions and marriages
- Adoption rights for same-sex couples
- Military service eligibility for LGBTQ+ individuals
- Anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity
- Democracy scores, used to explore correlations with legal protections

#### Key Insights
- Western democracies are leading in rights recognition, with widespread legalization of same-sex marriage and joint adoption.
- Countries in the Global South continue to lag behind, with many still criminalizing same-sex activity and offering little to no legal protection.
- A strong positive correlation was found between a country's democracy score and its level of LGBTQ+ rights recognition. Countries with higher democratic indices are significantly more likely to uphold protections and recognition for queer individuals.
- Progress is not linear: While some countries are advancing rapidly, others are experiencing legal and social regression in LGBTQ+ rights.

#### Conclusion
The findings make clear that while important strides have been made, global equity for LGBTQ+ people remains far from achieved. As Pride Month concludes, this analysis reaffirms that Pride must remain both a celebration and a call to action‚Äîfor universal dignity, safety, and equality.

    ### Statistical Analysis
    A two-sample t-test was conducted to compare the average democracy scores between countries that recognize same-sex marriage and those that do not.

    Results:
    - Mean democracy score (same-sex marriage recognized): {marriage_allowed:.2f}
    - Mean democracy score (not recognized): {marriage_not_allowed:.2f}
    - Mean difference: {mean_difference:.2f} points
    - T-statistic: {t_stat:.2f}
    - P-value: {p_value:.4f}

    Interpretation:
    The results indicate a statistically significant difference in democracy scores between the two groups (t(df) = {t_stat:.2f}, p = {p_value:.4f}), with countries recognizing same-sex marriage exhibiting substantially higher average democracy scores. This result is significant at the Œ± = 0.05 level, suggesting a strong association between democratic governance and the legal recognition of same-sex marriage.
